# Fixing Git Pull Errors (2025-04-26 15:27Z)

How do I fix this?

_**Assistant**_

I see you're encountering a Git error when trying to pull from the `feature/refresh` branch. This is a common situation when you have local commits and remote commits that have diverged. Git needs to know how you want to handle merging these different histories.

You have three options:

1. Merge strategy (creates a merge commit):
```bash
git config pull.rebase false
git pull --tags origin feature/refresh
```

2. Rebase strategy (replays your local commits on top of the remote changes):
```bash
git config pull.rebase true
git pull --tags origin feature/refresh
```

3. Fast-forward only (only allows pulls that can be fast-forwarded):
```bash
git config pull.ff only
git pull --tags origin feature/refresh
```

I recommend using the rebase strategy as it creates a cleaner, linear history. Let me help you set that up:



---

```bash
git config pull.rebase true
```

```

```

Now let's try pulling again:





---

```bash
git pull --tags origin feature/refresh
```

```
daviswhitehead@Daviss-MacBook-Pro--CellarTracker Digishelf % git pull --tags origin feature/refresh

I see we've hit a merge conflict in `app/pages/[userId]/shelves/[shelfId].js`. This means there are changes in both your local branch and the remote branch that affect the same parts of the file. Let's look at the conflict:




---

Read file: app/pages/[userId]/shelves/[shelfId].js

---

I see the conflict. The main differences are:

1. The remote branch (`9bb5ec8`) adds `useRef` to the React imports and removes `TouchableOpacity` from the react-native imports
2. There are some changes to the component's state and functionality

Let's resolve this conflict by keeping the newer changes from the remote branch while preserving any important local changes. I'll help you edit the file:




---

<details><summary>Edit file: app/pages/[userId]/shelves/[shelfId].js</summary>

Now that we've resolved the conflict, let's mark the file as resolved and continue with the rebase:




---

```bash
git add app/pages/[userId]/shelves/[shelfId].js
```

```
daviswhitehead@Daviss-MacBook-Pro--CellarTracker Digishelf % git add app/pages/[userId]/shelves/[shelfId].js
zsh: no matches found: app/pages/[userId]/shelves/[shelfId].js
daviswhitehead@Daviss-MacBook-Pro--CellarTracker Digishelf %
```

---

I apologize for the error. The square brackets in the file path are causing issues with the shell. Let's try with quotes:







---

```bash
git add "app/pages/[userId]/shelves/[shelfId].js"
```

```
daviswhitehead@Daviss-MacBook-Pro--CellarTracker Digishelf % 

```

---

Now let's continue with the rebase:









---

```bash
git rebase --continue
```
